===========

Moving to Denver or within Denver can be a game of speed, and waiting to sign a lease means you might lose out. AddyCaddy is designed to give prospective renters the ability to quickly compare two rental addresses based on criteria that is important to them. 

For example, if you have to walk the dog every morning, have young children, and like to accomplish your remote work from a coffee shop, you simply choose 'Parks', 'Safety', and 'Coffee Shops' from the criteria listed under your address comparison. AddyCaddy will return the number of occurrences or locations within a radius of each address that you specify, and then all you have to do is choose the best option.
